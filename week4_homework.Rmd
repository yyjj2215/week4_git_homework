## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1. library packages
```{r}
library(here)
library(sf)
library(usethis)
library(countrycode)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
```

# 2. read files
#shapefile
```{r}
map_data<-st_read(here::here('World_Countries_(Generalized)','World_Countries__Generalized_.shp'))
```
#csv file
```{r}
ggi<-read.csv('HDR21-22_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv')
```
#3.select columns(2019,2010)
```{r}
ggi1<-select(ggi,country, gii_2019, gii_2010,iso3)
```
#4. calculate difference
```{r}
ggi1$dif<-ggi1$gii_2019-ggi1$gii_2010
```
#5. ggi change iso(country name)
# map data iso are two, but ggi are three
```{r}
ggi2<-mutate(ggi1,iso2=countrycode(iso3, origin = 'iso3c', destination = 'iso2c'))
```
#6. join data
###why upper letter ISO doesn't work??????????
```{r}
final<-map_data%>%
  clean_names()%>%
  left_join(.,ggi2,by=c("iso"="iso2"))
```
#7. show map
```{r}
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
tmap_mode("plot")
qtm(final, 
    fill = "dif")
```
